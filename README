Project Name: Boosting Performance of CNN-mnist through Hardware acceleration

This is the github repo of the second project of course ECE1718S2 (2022) at University of Toronto.

Folder "design_files" includes all the design files in hardware

Folder "verification_files" is the verification environment of out design files
For each Folder inside "verification_files":
    HDL design files are inside the Folder "dut"
    Testbenches are inside the Folder "tb"
    C models for each sub_module is inside the Folder "c_model"
    "filelist.f" shows the files included for running testbench

Folder "weights" includes the weights for mnist and the input image

Folder "c_model" includes the software implementations.
    "weights.txt" is the trained weights used to skip training process to save time.
    "host_sent_img.cpp" simulate the process of sending images to hardware.
    "cnn_mnist-1_train1.cpp" feeds weights into the hardware.
    "cnn_mnist-1_inference_fp" simulates and verifies the final result.

The result from hardware is in the file "verification_files/forward_pass_top/res.txt"
Each line of data is a prediction result from an image.
First 16 bit is the result for label 0, last 16 bit is the result for label 9, etc.

The acceleration of this CNN code using SIMD and OpenCL can be found in the repo: https://github.com/JohnZ03/1718a1
